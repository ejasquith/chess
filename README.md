# Chess

## Project Overview

Chess as a game has been around since the 6th century and attracts players of any age, gender, or background, due to its easy-to-understand rules and deep strategic complexity.  

The purpose of this project is to provide a simple, browser-based tool for 2 players to play a game against each other, with none of the usual pressures of playing online (eg. rating).
