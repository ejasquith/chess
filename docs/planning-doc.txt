game board - 2d array - accessed via indices, first being letters second being numbers ([file][rank]) eg board[4][3] = e4

array of Square objects? js not class based - prototypes?

let board = [
	[Square, Square, ... Square],
	[Square, Square, ... Square],
	...
	[Square, Square, ... Square]
];

inherently polymorphic - piece prototype, subclasses override move method etc

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_prototypes

to define  prototype:

const myProto = {
	myProperty: myValue,
	myMethod() {
		some code;
	}
}

let myObject = Object.create(myProto);
myObject.myMethod();
