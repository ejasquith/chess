game board - 2d array - accessed via indices, first being letters second being numbers ([file][rank]) eg board[4][3] = e4

function getCoords(num1, num2) {
  let letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h'];
  return letters[num1] + (num2+1);
}
console.log(getCoords(4,3)); // 'e4'

array of Square objects? js not class based - prototypes?

let board = [
	[Square, Square, ... Square],
	[Square, Square, ... Square],
	...
	[Square, Square, ... Square]
];

maybe not square objects? - is there any special properties to the square that can't be achieved by just inserting divs into html grid

let board = [
  ['r', 'n', 'b', 'q', 'k', ... 'r'],   // 1st rank
  ['p', 'p', ... 'p'],                  // 2nd rank etc
  ['', '', ... ''],
  ['', '', ... ''],
  ...
  ['p', 'p', ... 'p'],
  ['r', 'n', 'b', 'q', 'k', ... 'r']
]
do we use letter representations or piece objects? have to use piece objects - need props like hasMoved etc, cant generate objects on the fly


inherently polymorphic - piece prototype, subclasses override move method etc

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_prototypes

to define prototype:

const myProto = {
	myProperty: myValue,
	myMethod() {
		some code;
	}
}

let myObject = Object.create(myProto);
myObject.myMethod();

custom constructor? pass in piece colour

wait hold on there are literally classes in js. oops.
